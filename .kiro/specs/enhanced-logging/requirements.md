# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive logging system for Neural Kitchen that captures application events, user actions, and system changes to both file storage and a web-based UI interface. The logging system will provide visibility into system operations, user activities, recipe changes, and other important events to support debugging, auditing, and system monitoring. This feature will be implemented after authentication is in place to ensure proper user attribution for logged events.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging of all application events written to files, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any significant application event occurs THEN the system SHALL write a structured log entry to a rotating log file
2. WHEN log files reach a configurable size limit THEN the system SHALL rotate logs and maintain a configurable number of historical files
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize the logging system and create necessary log directories
4. IF log writing fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without crashing the application
5. WHEN logging configuration changes THEN the system SHALL apply new settings without requiring application restart

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view application logs through the web UI, so that I can monitor system activity and debug issues without accessing server files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user with appropriate permissions accesses the logs page THEN the system SHALL display recent log entries from files in a paginated interface
2. WHEN viewing logs in the UI THEN the system SHALL provide filtering options by log level, timestamp range, and event type
3. WHEN new log entries are created THEN the system SHALL update the UI display in real-time by reading from log files
4. WHEN a user searches log entries THEN the system SHALL provide text-based search functionality across log file contents
5. IF log files are large THEN the system SHALL implement efficient file reading and pagination to avoid performance issues

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want detailed logging of all recipe and project changes, so that I can track modifications and understand system usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a recipe is created, updated, or deleted THEN the system SHALL log the action with user attribution, timestamp, and change details
2. WHEN a recipe version is created THEN the system SHALL log version creation with diff information
3. WHEN a project is modified THEN the system SHALL log project changes with affected fields and user information
4. WHEN tags are added or removed THEN the system SHALL log tag operations with entity references
5. WHEN search operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log search queries and result counts for analytics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want configurable log levels and categories, so that I can control the verbosity and focus of logging based on operational needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the logging system THEN the system SHALL support standard log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE)
2. WHEN setting log categories THEN the system SHALL allow enabling/disabling specific event types (auth, database, api, ui, system)
3. WHEN log level is set THEN the system SHALL only write log entries at or above the configured level
4. WHEN category filtering is applied THEN the system SHALL only log events from enabled categories
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL use safe defaults and log the configuration error

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want comprehensive audit logging of authentication and authorization events, so that I can track security-related activities and potential threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in or out THEN the system SHALL log authentication events with user identity, timestamp, and IP address
2. WHEN authorization checks occur THEN the system SHALL log access attempts with resource, user, and result
3. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL log requests with user context, endpoint, and response status
4. WHEN security violations occur THEN the system SHALL log security events with detailed context and severity
5. WHEN sensitive operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log administrative actions with full audit trail

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want log retention and archival policies, so that I can manage disk space while maintaining necessary historical data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN log files age beyond retention period THEN the system SHALL automatically archive or delete old logs based on policy
2. WHEN disk space is limited THEN the system SHALL implement size-based retention to prevent disk exhaustion
3. WHEN archiving logs THEN the system SHALL compress archived files to save storage space
4. WHEN retention policies are configured THEN the system SHALL validate settings and apply them consistently
5. IF retention cleanup fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and continue operating with existing logs
