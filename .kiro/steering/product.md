# Neural Kitchen Product Overview

Neural Kitchen is a recipe/cookbook management system designed specifically for AI agents and development teams. It serves as a structured knowledge base that captures institutional knowledge, coding patterns, and step-by-step workflows for AI-assisted development.

## Core Purpose

- **Recipe Management**: Create, version, and organize structured guidance documents ("recipes") for AI agents
- **Knowledge Capture**: Store institutional knowledge, coding patterns, and project-specific conventions
- **AI Integration**: Provide AI agents with contextual guidance through MCP (Model Context Protocol) interface
- **Team Collaboration**: Enable teams to build and share development knowledge across projects

## Key Features

- Recipe creation and versioning with diff visualization
- Natural language search using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Project-based organization and tagging system
- MCP server for AI agent integration
- Web interface for recipe management
- PostgreSQL with vector search capabilities

## Target Users

- Development teams using AI coding assistants
- AI agents that need structured guidance and context
- Organizations wanting to capture and share development knowledge
- Projects requiring consistent coding patterns and conventions

## Current Status

Early development phase with core functionality implemented. Focus is on establishing clear patterns and comprehensive documentation before expanding features.
