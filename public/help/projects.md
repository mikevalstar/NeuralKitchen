# Project Organization

Learn how to organize your recipes using projects and tags for better discoverability.

## What are Projects?

Projects in Neural Kitchen are collections of related recipes that belong to the same codebase, domain, or initiative. They help you:

- Group related recipes together
- Provide context for recipe usage
- Filter recipes by specific projects
- Organize your knowledge by domain

Projects will be referenced in your MCP connection to allow you to store recipes across projects.

## Creating Projects

1. **Navigate to Projects** - Click "Projects" in the main navigation
2. **Click "Create Project"** - Use the create button
3. **Fill in Details**:
   - **Title**: Descriptive project name
   - **Short ID**: Unique identifier for the project
   - **Description**: What this project encompasses

## Best Practices for Projects

### Project Organization
- **By Codebase**: One project per repository or major application
- **By Domain**: Group by business area (e.g., "User Management", "Payment Processing")
- **By Team**: Organize by team ownership or responsibility

## Using Tags for Cross-Project Organization

While projects group recipes by domain, tags categorize by:
- **Technology**: `react`, `nodejs`, `postgresql`
- **Type**: `setup`, `debugging`, `deployment`
- **Complexity**: `beginner`, `advanced`

## Combining Projects and Tags

A recipe about "Setting up React testing" might be:
- **Project**: "E-commerce Frontend"
- **Tags**: `react`, `testing`, `setup`

This allows filtering by either project context or technical category.

## Managing Project Relationships

When creating or editing recipes:
1. Select relevant projects
2. Recipes can belong to multiple projects
3. Use the project filter on the recipes page to focus on specific domains
