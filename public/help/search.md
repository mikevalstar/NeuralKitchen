# Search and Discovery

Neural Kitchen provides powerful search capabilities to help you find the right recipes quickly.

## Search Features

### Semantic Search
Our AI-powered search understands the meaning behind your queries:
- **Natural Language**: "How to set up authentication"
- **Context Aware**: Finds relevant recipes even if exact words don't match
- **Similarity Based**: Uses vector embeddings to understand content relationships

### Text Search Fallback
If semantic search doesn't find results, we automatically fall back to traditional text search:
- Searches recipe titles and content
- Supports partial word matching
- Prioritizes title matches over content matches

## Using Search Effectively

### Search Tips
- **Be Descriptive**: "React component testing" vs "testing"
- **Use Keywords**: Include relevant technology terms
- **Ask Questions**: "How to deploy Next.js app" works well
- **Try Variations**: If first search doesn't work, rephrase

### Search Results
Each result shows:
- **Recipe Title**: Click to view full recipe
- **AI Summary**: Quick overview of what the recipe does
- **Relevance Score**: How closely it matches your query
