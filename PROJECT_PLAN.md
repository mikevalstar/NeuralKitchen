# Neural Kitchen - Project Plan

## Overview

Neural Kitchen is a recipe/cookbook management system designed specifically for AI agents and development teams. It provides structured guidance and examples for AI development workflows, capturing institutional knowledge and providing contextual guidance through an MCP (Model Context Protocol) interface.

**Current Status**: Working prototype with core functionality complete - recipe management, search, MCP server, and help system.
