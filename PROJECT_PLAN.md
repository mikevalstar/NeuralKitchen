  - [x] Add project metadata fields (description, shortId, created/updated dates)
  - [x] Implement soft delete for projects
  - [x] Run database migration

- [x] **Projects CRUD Operations**
  - [x] Create `src/lib/data/projects.ts` with namespace pattern
  - [x] Implement `Projects.list()`, `Projects.create()`, `Projects.read()`, `Projects.update()`, `Projects.delete()`
  - [x] Add Zod validation schemas in `dataValidators.ts`
  - [x] Add server functions for project operations

- [x] **Projects UI**

  - [x] Add recipe tags and project relationships

- [x] **Recipe CRUD Operations**
  - [x] Create `src/lib/data/recipes.ts` with full CRUD operations
  - [x] Implement recipe versioning logic, saving creates new version automatically
  - [x] Add content hashing to prevent duplicate versions
  - [x] Implement version management (create, read, revert functionality)

- [x] **Recipe UI - Viewing**
  - [x] Create `/recipes` route with recipe listing and container queries
  - [x] Implement recipe detail page with markdown rendering using `react-markdown`
  - [x] Add metadata sidebar with tags, projects, and version info
  - [x] Create responsive recipe table with width toggle support

- [x] **Recipe UI - Editing**

  - [x] Create recipe creation form with rich text editing
  - [x] Add tag selection interface with toggle functionality
  - [x] Implement project association with detailed project cards
  - [x] Add dark mode support for MDX editor with custom styling
  - [x] Add editor mode toggle buttons (rich text, diff, source)
  - [x] Create recipe edit page with version management
  - [x] Implement automatic new version creation on save

### 1.3 Summaries, Vectorization & Search
- [x] **Make a Queue System**
  - [x] Create a data class to manage the queue, it should pop off the top 1 at a time
  - [x] Create a loop based on setTimeout to pull from the queue every 5 seconds
  - [x] When a new article is created/updated add it to the queue to summarize
- [x] **Summarize new versions of docs**
  - [x] In the loop call OPENAI to summarize the document using a cheap model (gpt-4o-mini)
  - [x] Update the version in the DB with the summary
  - [x] Show the summary on the recipe view page
- [x] **Embed Versions of Docs**
  - [x] Create vec table for search later following https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/database/postgres-extensions
  - [x] On the same loop call embed the first few thousand tokens (6000 tokens using text-embedding-3-small)
  - [x] Add embedding to the table following the guide above using $executeRaw
  - [x] Add proper version management - mark old embeddings as not current when new versions created
- [x] **Add vector search to UI**
  - [x] Add a search bar above the recipe list
  - [x] Add a backend search using the vector search to get the top 10 results
  - [x] Search should send you to a new page (/search) showing a google style search results (top 10 for now)
  - [x] The results should show the short summary below the title and be clickable
  - [x] Added hybrid search (vector + text fallback) for better reliability
  - [x] Added search to main navigation 
- [ ] **Add queue visualization page**
  - [ ] Add a page to the ui to see the recent and pending queued items
