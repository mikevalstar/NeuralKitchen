# Neural Kitchen - Project Plan

## Overview

Neural Kitchen is a recipe/cookbook management system designed specifically for AI agents and development teams. It provides structured guidance and examples for AI development workflows, capturing institutional knowledge and providing contextual guidance through an MCP (Model Context Protocol) interface.

**Current Status**: Working prototype with core functionality complete - recipe management, search, MCP server, and help system.

  - [ ] Project-based bulk export

- [ ] **Recipe Import**
  - [ ] Single recipe import
  - [ ] Bulk import with conflict resolution

- [ ] **Content Packages**
  - [ ] Create importable Neural Kitchen example package
  - [ ] Template packages for common project types

### 2.4 Auth
- [ ] **Basic Auth Options**
  - [ ] Basic auth with better-auth
  - [ ] CLI Create user setup
  - [ ] Simple User Management Tools (UI)

### 2.5 Public Website
Make a public website, separate repo

## Advanced Features & Usability Stage ðŸ”§
*Goal: Enhance user experience and add advanced functionality based on real-world usage*

### Ideas
- [ ] Usage Tracking (from the MCP server)

---

## Development Principles

### Quality First
- Every feature should solve a real problem for AI-assisted development
- Prioritize simplicity and usability over feature complexity
- Comprehensive testing and documentation for all features

### AI-Centric Design
- All features should enhance AI agent effectiveness
- Content should be optimized for AI consumption and understanding
- MCP integration should be seamless and powerful

### Community Focus
- Enable teams to build and share institutional knowledge
- Support collaborative workflows and knowledge transfer
- Make it easy to onboard new team members with captured expertise

---

## Notes

- Each stage builds upon the previous one
- Features can be moved between stages based on user feedback and priorities
- Regular user testing should guide feature prioritization
- Consider community feedback for Stage 3 feature selection
